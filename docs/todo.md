# TODO

## Next Steps

1. **Sample Data** - Add populateSampleData() functions to remaining workbooks (only TDS has it currently)
2. **User Testing** - Get feedback from actual auditors
3. **Performance** - Optimize for large datasets (>1000 rows)

## Future Enhancements

- Export to Excel/PDF
- Import from accounting systems
- Additional standards (Ind AS 19, 36, 21, 37)
- Multi-entity consolidation

## Known Limitations

- Requires Google Sheets (no offline mode)
- Large datasets may be slow
- Mobile not recommended
