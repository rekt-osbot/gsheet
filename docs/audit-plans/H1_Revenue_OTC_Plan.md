## SAMPLING STRATEGY

### Statistical Basis
- **Population**: All invoices in H1 (estimated 200-300)
- **Sample Size**: 30 invoices (10-15% of population)
- **Confidence Level**: 90%
- **Tolerable Error**: 5%

### Stratification
- By revenue stream (BPO, Ticketing)
- By month (ensure all 6 months covered)
- By value (high, medium, low)
- By customer (major customers fully covered)

### Judgmental Samples
- All foreign currency transactions (high risk)
- All credit notes (control critical)
- Month-end transactions (cut-off risk)
- New customers in H1 (onboarding control)
