## 🔍 SAMPLING QUICK REFERENCE

### When to Test 100%
- High-risk items (e.g., all new vendors)
- Small populations (<10 items)
- Critical controls (e.g., all forex receipts)
- Automated tests (e.g., invoice sequence)

### When to Sample
- Large populations (>20 items)
- Medium/low risk items
- Routine transactions

### How to Sample
1. **Stratify**: Group by value, type, month
2. **Select High-Value**: Always include largest items
3. **Random Selection**: Use random number generator for rest
4. **Ensure Coverage**: All months, all categories
5. **Document**: Note why you selected each sample

### Minimum Sample Sizes
- High-risk controls: 25-30 samples
- Medium-risk controls: 15-20 samples
- Low-risk controls: 10-15 samples
- Transactions: 50% of value or minimum 5 samples

## 📊 DATA ANALYTICS TIPS (TM3 Specific)

### Tally Data Extraction
1. Export to Excel (not PDF)
2. Include all columns
3. Don't filter before export

5. Work on a copy

### Common Analytics
- **Sequence Testing**: Check for gaps in invoice/voucher numbers
- **Duplicate Detection**: Sort by amount, vendor, date
- **Round Amount Analysis**: Filter for amounts ending in 000
- **Weekend Transactions**: Filter by date (Sat/Sun)
- **Outlier Detection**: Sort by amount (high to low)
- **Trend Analysis**: Pivot table by month

### Red Flags to Look For
- 🚩 Gaps in numbering
- 🚩 Duplicate payments
- 🚩 Round amounts (exactly ₹50,000)
- 🚩 Weekend/holiday entries
- 🚩 Same vendor, same amount, multiple times
